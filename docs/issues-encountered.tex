\section{Issues encountered}

During the development process very few issues were serious enough to slow down notably the progress of the compiler.\\
Some minor inconveniences were:
\begin{itemize}
    \item figuring out the right assembler instructions for lack of beginner-friendly documentation on the internet
    \item experimenting with the stack to figure out the exact location of all arguments
    \item setting up the assembler header instructions (\t{.text}, \t{.align 8}, ...)
\end{itemize}

More anecdotally:
\begin{itemize}
    \item \textasciitilde 30min spent figuring out why \t{printf} segfaults when \t{rax} is not zeroed before the call
    \item \textasciitilde 1h spent identifying and fixing a stack alignment issue (\t{rsp} has to be a multiple of 16)
\end{itemize}
