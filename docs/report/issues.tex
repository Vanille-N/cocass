\section{Issues encountered}

During the development process very few issues were serious enough to slow down notably the progress of the compiler.\\
Some minor inconveniences were:
\begin{itemize}
    \item figuring out the right x86 instructions for lack of beginner-friendly documentation on the internet (at least 1h)
    \item experimenting with the stack to figure out the exact location of all arguments (several hours)
    \item setting up the assembler header instructions (\t{.text}, \t{.align 8}, ...) (at least 30min)
\end{itemize}

More anecdotally:
\begin{itemize}
    \item more than 30min spent figuring out why \t{printf} segfaults when \t{rax} is not zeroed before the call
    \item more than 1h spent identifying and fixing a stack alignment issue (\t{rsp} has to be a multiple of 16)
\end{itemize}

Although I believe I succeeded in specifying the complete (apart from variadic arguments) semantics of extended C\textminus\textminus, I tried and failed to implement them in Coq. The main reason for that failure is the semantic abstraction of the memory: each value being spread over 8 bytes makes it very difficult to establish the required properties of the memory.
