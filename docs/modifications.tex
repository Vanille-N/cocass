\section{Modifications}
The following changes were made to existing constructs of the AST.\\
Each comes with an explanation of why it was deemed necessary in the context of other additions to the language.

\subsection{Assignments}
\t{SET} replaces both \t{SET\_VAR} and \t{SET\_ARRAY} as well as what was for some time \t{SET\_DEREF}.\\
\begin{itemize}
    \item \t{x = 1;}
    \not\to\ \ml{SET_VAR("x", CST 1)}
    \to\ \ml{SET(VAR "x", CST 1)}
    \item \t{t[0] = 1;}
    \not\to\ \ml{SET_ARRAY("t", CST 0, CST 1)}
    \to\ \ml{SET(OP2(S_INDEX, VAR "t", CST 0), CST 1)}
    \item \t{*x = 1}
    \not\to\ \ml{SET_DEREF("x", CST 1)}
    \to\ \ml{SET(OP1(M_DEREF, VAR "x"), CST 1)}
\end{itemize}
